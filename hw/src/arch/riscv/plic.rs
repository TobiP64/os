	/// If PLIC supports Interrupt Priorities, then each PLIC interrupt source can
	/// be assigned a priority by writing to its 32-bit memory-mapped priority register.
	/// A priority value of 0 is reserved to mean ''never interrupt'' and effectively
	/// disables the interrupt. Priority 1 is the lowest active priority while the
	/// maximun level of priority depends on PLIC implementation. Ties between global
	/// interrupts of the same priority are broken by the Interrupt ID; interrupts
	/// with the lowest ID have the highest effective priority.
	priority: [u32; 1024],
	/// The current status of the interrupt source pending bits in the PLIC core can
	/// be read from the pending array, organized as 32-bit register. The pending bit
	/// for interrupt ID N is stored in bit (N mod 32) of word (N/32). Bit 0 of word 0,
	/// which represents the non-existent interrupt source 0, is hardwired to zero.
	///
	/// A pending bit in the PLIC core can be cleared by setting the associated enable
	/// bit then performing a claim.

	/// Each global interrupt can be enabled by setting the corresponding bit in the
	/// enables register. The enables registers are accessed as a contiguous array of
	/// 32-bit registers, packed the same way as the pending bits. Bit 0 of enable
	/// register 0 represents the non-existent interrupt ID 0 and is hardwired to 0.
	/// PLIC has 15872 Interrupt Enable blocks for the contexts. The context is referred
	/// to the specific privilege mode in the specific Hart of specific RISC-V processor
	/// instance. How PLIC organizes interrupts for the contexts (Hart and privilege mode)
	/// is out of RISC-V PLIC specification scope, however it must be spec-out in vendorâ€™s
	/// PLIC specification.

struct Context {
	/// LIC provides context based threshold register for the settings of a interrupt
	/// priority threshold of each context. The threshold register is a WARL field.
	/// The PLIC will mask all PLIC interrupts of a priority less than or equal to
	/// threshold. For example, a `threshold` value of zero permits all interrupts
	/// with non-zero priority.
	priority:       u32,
	/// Interrupt Claim Process
	///
	/// The PLIC can perform an interrupt claim by reading the claim/complete register,
	/// which returns the ID of the highest priority pending interrupt or zero if there
	/// is no pending interrupt. A successful claim will also atomically clear the
	/// corresponding pending bit on the interrupt source.
	///
	/// The PLIC can perform a claim at any time and the claim operation is not affected
	/// by the setting of the priority threshold register. The Interrupt Claim Process
	/// register is context based and is located at (4K alignement + 4) starts from
	/// offset 0x200000.
	///
	/// Interrupt Completion
	///
	/// The PLIC signals it has completed executing an interrupt handler by writing the
	/// interrupt ID it received from the claim to the claim/complete register. The PLIC
	/// does not check whether the completion ID is the same as the last claim ID for that
	/// target. If the completion ID does not match an interrupt source that is currently
	/// enabled for the target, the completion is silently ignored. The Interrupt Completion
	/// registers are context based and located at the same address with Interrupt Claim
	/// Process register, which is at (4K alignement + 4) starts from offset 0x200000.
